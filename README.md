# Design of a Thermal-Vacuum Chamber for Structural Tests of Pressure and Temperature on 1U, 1.5U, 2U, 2.5U and 3U CubeSat Satellites.
A project to design a test-bench for thermal and pressure conditions in which a CubeSat satellite is subjected in space. 

## Year: 2021 - 2023.

# Objectives. 

## General Objective. 

Establish the design of a thermovacuum chamber that allows structural pressure and temperature tests on 1U, 1.5U, 2U, 2.5U and 3U CubeSat-type satellites, in order to guarantee the resistance of the equipment during space launch.

## Specific Objectives. 

1. Investigate the background and current technological progress in different countries, within the aerospace field to define the evolution of thermovacuum chambers and the relevant technical principles for the design. 
2. Analyze the current situation of CubeSat-type satellites of 1U, 1.5U, 2U, 2.5U and 3U, to establish the compliance criteria for the thermovacuum chamber in accordance with international standards in the aerospace sector.
3. Identify the methodological framework for the training and development of the proposed solution to the problem raised.
4. Select the materials and instruments necessary to measure and control the pressure and temperature variables in the system, providing an alternative in the construction of the thermovacuum chamber.
5. Simulate the vacuum conditions to check the resistance of the chamber materials with respect to the pressure values of the tests standardized by NASA.
6. Quote the instruments and materials of the thermovacuum chamber so that this proposal is taken into consideration as a future prototype.
